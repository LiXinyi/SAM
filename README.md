# SAM
The datasets contain log-scale SAM volume measurements, binary SNP genotypes at 148,793 markers, and log-scale measures of abundance for 22,903 transcripts for each of 368 maize inbred lines in the SAM panel.
These data support the data analysis in the manuscript "Additive Partially Linear Models for Ultra-high-dimensional Regression".

To read the .rda files, use command 
"load(file="SAM_RNA_Seq.rda")"
"load(file="SAM_SNP.rda")"
in R.
